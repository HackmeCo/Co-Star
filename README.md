# Co-Star
By [HackMeCo](https://github.com/hackmeco)

Have you ever found yourself in the situation where you know that two actors or actresses have starred in a movie together, but can't quite place what movie? 

[**_Co-Star_**](https://co-star.herokuapp.com) is here to help! Co-Star is an application for searching movies by multiple actors, allowing you to always find your answer.

For movie trivia buffs, Co-Star also features a game component, which turns the tables around on you -- we give you a pair of actors, and you have to tell us the movie! Compete with other users to get on our leaderboard!
